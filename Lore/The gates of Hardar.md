Hundreds of years ago there were gateways across the word, they required a lot of fuel but once activated they could transport a small army from the Plane of Hardar to the material plane, the gates are fueled by the souls of whom ever dies within the "gates", to the known world the gates only work as mysterious contraptions with no known origin.

For 2600 years this day there was a great war, the war was a fight against the forces of "Evil" and Good". There were three allies in this war:

The angles, celestial beings helping the Tryax Forces

  The gem Dragons, the few known remaining ones helping the Visioneer Clan, compiled of strong wizards and Sorcerers.

  The Devils and demonic beings helping the Ferrum Axis

            The demonic beings promised the kings all the power they could ever imagine and to no longer need to fear death, they used their power to corrupt the kings minds with visions of their demise by the hand of the other nations. The demons asssisted the kings with an army, the army was demonic beings wearing full black armor. They all wore the iconic symbol of the Ferrum Axis on their armor and shields, they were firce in combat and skilled with the blade, tales have been told of them beating an 5000 man army with only 2000 soldiers. Their large army was transported through gates, know reffered to as the "Gates of Hardar". The gates powered by souls of those killed within them. With enough power the gates can once again be reactivated and a new invasnion will be launched. These gates were spread across the nations, mostly on the west side, but with some in the nation of Khun. The Axis consited of the nations of Malum, Nish

  This huge war is known as the Dark Age and The Final War, where the word mercy and peace was long forgotten,

  Basically= Demons wants to kill everyone, Angels wants to rule the world as Dictators and the Magicans are the rebelious fighting for the freedom of the living?
