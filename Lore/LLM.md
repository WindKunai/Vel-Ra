Symbol: A blooming flower surrounded by swirling energy.<br><br>In the beginning there was nothing, rather darkness, the one plane of existence nothing lived, nothing died, there was nothing and there would be nothing, the darkness was comprised of<br><br>There was nothing, there had never been anything yet somehow Xherus appeared within the void. Xherus was everything, everything that was, everything that could be, Xherus drew its power from the void, their energies were shared, connected. It grew stronger, the void became unstable with Xherus growing inside of it, Xherus became too strong and the void attempted to separate itself from it, separating the void from the true plane. Without the void to feed off of Xherus craving more began to feed of it self, it grew unstable and began to tear itself apart. Within the true plane Xherus consumed itself, tearing itself to shreds, eating and feeding of itself. The shreds separated, the parts of Xherus that feasted on itself continued to absorb itself, within the true plane the shreds became void stones across the plane, absorbing and sucking anything and everything close enough within its grasp. The stones absorbed everything of Xherus, the stones then floated through the true plane and whenever the stones got within each others pull they eventually collided, absorbing each other and becoming one, a smaller stone. The coalition of stones continued until every stone had been absorbed by one stone, the stone was infinitely small and was in the centre of the true plane. The stone continued to feed on it itself, without anything to consume it remained within the true plane. Without anything to absorb the stone grew unstable once more, the stone needed something to feed on to stabilize it, however there was nothing for it to feast on, and so the stone collapsed on itself. The explosion expanded in every direction and broke the true planes parameters, the tiny pieces of the true plane was lost as the mass from Xherus was shattered, its contents now spread, the masses formed bubbles, tiny planar dimensions with the void now expanding and further sepperating the planes from each other, preventing Xherus to return and again feast on it. The Void become known as the astral sea, the sea that separated the different dimensional planner worlds.<br><br>Within one of the planar dimensions were there slivers of remains from what had been Xherus, however the pieces were separated. The different energies of Xherus formed conciusness and became mighty beings, they fought, for power, to absorb each other. What had happened in the true pane repeated itself, the energies was absorbed by one entity absorbed everything but was contained within the dimensional pocket, making it run out of energy to take, it began to absorb itself just like what had happened in the true plane. The void stone grew unstable and collapsed in on itself, bursting its contents throughout the dimensional pocket. The slivers of Xherus were even smaller and the other contents of the void pearl created planes within the dimensional pocket and the energies of Xherus was trapped within. Within the planes the smaller pieces of Xherus were unstable and too spread out, making most of them collapse in on themselves spreading its energy as even weaker in the form of mass. The explosion of mass spread across the planes, however there were those energy beings that were close enough to absorb each other and become conscious, retaining their own form as powerful beings of the universes created. However hese powerful beings needed a way to stabilize, as the Xherus energy was diminishing. Throughout the planes the masses floating in space were pulled together due to their gravity, planets and suns formed, the planes were filled with endless seas of stars, gass and planets.<br><br>Life sprung forth on a fortitude of planets with the right conditions, the Xheus beings took notice and realized the potential. There were the ones who slaughtered whole planets to absorb their Xheus energy while others approached the civilizations, attempting to guide them and control them as livestock. Time passed and further more Xheus beings faded into void stones and collapsed, but the ones that remained grew in strength. In the beginning they constantly fought against one another, but over time some learned to co-exist. One of the planets where life grew forth was Dewize. It was a planet with lots of potential, a race of civilization grew forth, a race of large humanoids called «Strixen», they created the first civilizations and fought amongst each other, they finally united once other humanoid creatures began to surge, they combined their efforts and annihilated every other humanoids, leaving them alone on the planet. They were physically gifted and bright creatures who became an advanced civilization. There was a consciousness by the name Erak who came to the planet and gave some of the Strixen some of its power, converting them to worship it, making it stronger. Other mighty beings learned of the planet Dewize and sought to convert the planet. As more and more such beings arrived they were given the title of Gozeds, gods, mighty beings. The Gozeds fought amongst each other for the power over the planet, it was a lasting war that resulted in the god Erak absorbing more Xherus energy and growing in power. Another Gozed Yemik, on par with Erak fought a devastating war which ultimately lead to a shard of the planet breaking off and natural disasters making the race of striven go extinct.<br><br>Erak was ultimately victorious and Yamik fled weakened. However Erak was too weakened heavily, its essence began to become unstable, and Erak ended up splitting into multiple lesser entities that needed time to stabilize. The shard that broke off started to orbit the planet and became its moon, but the impact from it being ripped off destroyed all life on the planet. After the different consciousnesses of Erak stabilized they grew independent and sought more power. However, Dewize was still far too uninhabitable. The lesser Gozed worked together as they fixed the planet and independently created their own races that were to worship them. The strongest of the essences: Brimir created the race of giants in the image of Strixen, but made them larger and stronger wanting them to be more durable. Nireka was another of the lesser gozed, she created what is known as sylvan creatures. Kirtath is known as the godzed of dragons, creating the first breeds of them. Visse was the last of the essence, that spirit created the humanoids and such of the sea, such as merfolk. Another gozed also created a race, Yamik created the race of humans, in the image of Strixen, but smaller and with a shorter lifespan. He made them to worship him but the other gozed with the strength from their followers were strong enough to banish Yamik to another plane. The races of the planet were ordered to kill all humans, as they were the creation of their enemy. The purge lasted for centuries, however humans were clever creatures and like a pest impossible to get rid off. The Humans adapted to every change they encountered and proved to be resilient creatures, they however abandoned their following of Yamik as it no longer could help them. After hundreds of years some became followers of the other gozed. These followers learned of the true gozed Erak, and so the humans founded a new religion. Following the gozed Erak, the humans devoted their faith towards the being and over many years the true form of Erak, at least shards of it began to be created. Time passed on and the Gozed Erak had bed re-formed by the Xherus energy.<br><br>Eraks power but so did Yamiks, some humans had turned to follow the banished god as their savior and so did its bidding for it. Through the instructions of Yamik planar portals were created throughout Dewize, portals connected to the plane of which Yamik was sendt. Once the portal was opened Yamik again attacked the planet, a large war of the races of Dewize against monstrous beings created by Yamik. The war costed countless lives and left the world in ruin, the gozed of Dewize banded once more together to destroy Yamik, however their attempts were futile as Yamik had many followers, making it powerful enough to reform itself. They ended up splitting the essence of Yamik into different pieces and again banished all the different pieces of its essence. The gozed created the world seals, rune seals across different places of Dewize. To secure no one else could open them the gazed left a requirement to breaking the seals to be that it was only possible if the five runes were broken once by each race that been created by the Gozeds. Time passed and times of despair followed after the war, food shortage, loss of workforce took lives in most societies. The one that claimed the most was the humiz disease, a bacterial disease that was rumored to be carried by all humans, it was deadly and most often carried by pesticides. The hardship brought by the times lead to a division between the races, it became a struggle to survive at it at each race for themselves. The conflict between the races was also translated to the gozed as they also became distanced from each other. Accusations and rumors escalated and the breaking point was reached between Brimir and Kirtath as a war between the giants and dragons broke out. Lives were lost and the thousand year war resulted in the population of dragons and giants becoming greatly diminished.<br><br>With the civilizations booming in size disease and population control follows, another pandemic hit the world, and hit it hard. The Death curse pandemic was extremely deadly and spread like fire. However the nations of Drasmoor and Valuk were the ones who got most out of the pandemic, their boarders expanded exponentially due to them being religiously ruled states. Other nations weren’t as lucky as larger percentiles of their population were completely wiped out. Another rumor of the disease was that it severed one’s connection to the Ixrica Particle, this so was only for those with innate spellcasting, meaning religious priests and bishops kept their magic as their magic was borrowed. Since Drasmoor and Valuk suffered minimal losses they utilized the situation to launch holy conquests into neighboring land taking it for themselves to expand their empires. Both nations were followers of the god Erak and its three forms. The Nations who lost large percentiles were in ruins, it resulted in many abandoning their homes, the nation they lived in to move to a city where others could be found, this lead to the destruction of racal nations, as the races met in these havens, creating new cities and nations of mixed races. Time passed and the new nations grew exponentially and so did the human percentile, it skyrocketed, making humans the most common race around the world.<br><br>Timeline<br><br>Year        Event        Description<br><br>The Annihilation        Godzen Erak and Yemik fought.<br><br>B.

to kill everyone, Angels wants to rule the world as Dictators and the Magicans are the rebelious fighting for the freedom of the living?<br><br>Allied Nations: Drasmoor, Valuk and Orevora<br><br>basically the party worked for Alvan Hoff third oldest son to the newly apointed royal family, they were the head of an adventuring guild but gained so much power within the nation they managed to overthrow the reigning elven family, the party first worked with Alvan transporting supplies to the front lines (uneasy times ment they were ready for war) they then explored the nation and wound up reaching the capital, where they walked around, they went too deep in the sewers looking for the black market and wound up crossing paths with an aspect of Gravator, a slime being resting in the sewers snatching bodies and replacing them with slime clones retaining their memories and such, Alvan turns out made a deal with the slime allowing the party to retain their memories but not their bodies, they threatened to kill him and so he made them sign a soul contract with a tiefling friend of his that their souls was now his to command, some time passed they attended an auction to snuff out rebellion sympothisers (turns out a last heir to the elven family lives and they were tasked with finding her and her allies) they instead befriend Velzane a powerful merchant in the city, she knows powerful mind altering magic which lets them talk without Gravator knowing, they get a new list from her of who to frame, time pass they do stuff eventually peace negotiations with Malum occur they attent to safekeep it, then marching is heard, Velzane, the prinecess Pierconaw arrives and so other rebels, they fight Velzane is revealed to be a powerful dragon in disguise and so fight, turns out the representative from the invading nation Malum is a powerful fiend and joins the fight, eventually teleporting out, in the fight it is discovered that Alvan replaced the royal family with slimes and planned to do so with the malum diplomats, they fight destroy Gravator and Velzane gets the planar key, the item which allows Gravator to manifest in the material plane, before the peace negotiations happened their soul contract was changed as a product of the fiend "friend" of alvan instead binding them to him instead (Siccarus) they then met up with him wondering what they can do to free themselves, he asks for the Sundering Veil to be retrived, a powerful artefact from dwarven times (containing the Soul of Duccah an evil giant lich who was the king of giants and kept dwarves as slaves) they travel to underdark, wound up freeing duccah cuz didnt want fiends to have his magic and so returned to the surface (the artefact was in the underdark given to the drow from Alvan in return they summoned the gravator avatar) and now party talked with Velzane she didnt have much for them to do and so traveled west into occupied terretory they fight fiends and help rebels and now have a list of targets, they convinced Targen to not aid the occupation and now begin their travels to Larkspur:<br><br>Basically:<br><br>Byer -> Generaler<br><br>Viktige:<br><br>- By: Bullmar ->

Xherus was everything, everything that was, everything that could be, Xherus drew its power from the void, their energies were shared, connected. It grew stronger, the void became unstable with Xherus growing inside of it, Xherus became too strong and the void attempted to separate itself from it, separating the void from the true plane. Without the void to feed off of Xherus craving more began to feed of it self, it grew unstable and began to tear itself apart. Within the true plane Xherus consumed itself, tearing itself to shreds, eating and feeding of itself. The shreds separated, the parts of Xherus that feasted on itself continued to absorb itself, within the true plane the shreds became void stones across the plane, absorbing and sucking anything and everything close enough within its grasp. The stones absorbed everything of Xherus, the stones then floated through the true plane and whenever the stones got within each others pull they eventually collided, absorbing each other and becoming one, a smaller stone. The coalition of stones continued until every stone had been absorbed by one stone, the stone was infinitely small and was in the centre of the true plane. The stone continued to feed on it itself, without anything to consume it remained within the true plane. Without anything to absorb the stone grew unstable once more, the stone needed something to feed on to stabilize it, however there was nothing for it to feast on, and so the stone collapsed on itself. The explosion expanded in every direction and broke the true planes parameters, the tiny pieces of the true plane was lost as the mass from Xherus was shattered, its contents now spread, the masses formed bubbles, tiny planar dimensions with the void now expanding and further sepperating the planes from each other, preventing Xherus to return and again feast on it. The Void become known as the astral sea, the sea that separated the different dimensional planner worlds.<br><br>Within one of the planar dimensions were there slivers of remains from what had been Xherus, however the pieces were separated. The different energies of Xherus formed conciusness and became mighty beings, they fought, for power, to absorb each other. What had happened in the true pane repeated itself, the energies was absorbed by one entity absorbed everything but was contained within the dimensional pocket, making it run out of energy to take, it began to absorb itself just like what had happened in the true plane. The void stone grew unstable and collapsed in on itself, bursting its contents throughout the dimensional pocket. The slivers of Xherus were even smaller and the other contents of the void pearl created planes within the dimensional pocket and the energies of Xherus was trapped within. Within the planes the smaller pieces of Xherus were unstable and too spread out, making most of them collapse in on themselves spreading its energy as even weaker in the form of mass. The explosion of mass spread across the planes, however there were those energy beings that were close enough to absorb each other and become conscious, retaining their own form as powerful beings of the universes created. However hese powerful beings needed a way to stabilize, as the Xherus energy was diminishing. Throughout the planes the masses floating in space were pulled together due to their gravity, planets and suns formed, the planes were filled with endless seas of stars, gass and planets.<br><br>Life sprung forth on a fortitude of planets with the right conditions, the Xheus beings took notice and realized the potential. There were the ones who slaughtered whole planets to absorb their Xheus energy while others approached the civilizations, attempting to guide them and control them as livestock. Time passed and further more Xheus beings faded into void stones and collapsed, but the ones that remained grew in strength. In the beginning they constantly fought against one another, but over time some learned to co-exist. One of the planets where life grew forth was Dewize. It was a planet with lots of potential, a race of civilization grew forth, a race of large humanoids called «Strixen», they created the first civilizations and fought amongst each other, they finally united once other humanoid creatures began to surge, they combined their efforts and annihilated every other humanoids, leaving them alone on the planet. They were physically gifted and bright creatures who became an advanced civilization. There was a consciousness by the name Erak who came to the planet and gave some of the Strixen some of its power, converting them to worship it, making it stronger. Other mighty beings learned of the planet Dewize and sought to convert the planet. As more and more such beings arrived they were given the title of Gozeds, gods, mighty beings. The Gozeds fought amongst each other for the power over the planet, it was a lasting war that resulted in the god Erak absorbing more Xherus energy and growing in power. Another Gozed Yemik, on par with Erak fought a devastating war which ultimately lead to a shard of the planet breaking off and natural disasters making the race of striven go extinct.<br><br>Erak was ultimately victorious and Yamik fled weakened. However Erak was too weakened heavily, its essence began to become unstable, and Erak ended up splitting into multiple lesser entities that needed time to stabilize. The shard that broke off started to orbit the planet and became its moon, but the impact from it being ripped off destroyed all life on the planet. After the different consciousnesses of Erak stabilized they grew independent and sought more power. However, Dewize was still far too uninhabitable. The lesser Gozed worked together as they fixed the planet and independently created their own races that were to worship them. The strongest of the essences: Brimir created the race of giants in the image of Strixen, but made them larger and stronger wanting them to be more durable. Nireka was another of the lesser gozed, she created what is known as sylvan creatures. Kirtath is known as the godzed of dragons, creating the first breeds of them. Visse was the last of the essence, that spirit created the humanoids and such of the sea, such as merfolk. Another gozed also created a race, Yamik created the race of humans, in the image of Strixen, but smaller and with a shorter lifespan. He made them to worship him but the other gozed with the strength from their followers were strong enough to banish Yamik to another plane. The races of the planet were ordered to kill all humans, as they were the creation of their enemy. The purge lasted for centuries, however humans were clever creatures and like a pest impossible to get rid off. The Humans adapted to every change they encountered and proved to be resilient creatures, they however abandoned their following of Yamik as it no longer could help them. After hundreds of years some became followers of the other gozed. These followers learned of the true gozed Erak, and so the humans founded a new religion. Following the gozed Erak, the humans devoted their faith towards the being and over many years the true form of Erak, at least shards of it began to be created. Time passed on and the Gozed Erak had bed re-formed by the Xherus energy.<br><br>Eraks power but so did Yamiks, some humans had turned to follow the banished god as their savior and so did its bidding for it. Through the instructions of Yamik planar portals were created throughout Dewize, portals connected to the plane of which Yamik was sendt. Once the portal was opened Yamik again attacked the planet, a large war of the races of Dewize against monstrous beings created by Yamik. The war costed countless lives and left the world in ruin, the gozed of Dewize banded once more together to destroy Yamik, however their attempts were futile as Yamik had many followers, making it powerful enough to reform itself. They ended up splitting the essence of Yamik into different pieces and again banished all the different pieces of its essence. The gozed created the world seals, rune seals across different places of Dewize. To secure no one else could open them the gazed left a requirement to breaking the seals to be that it was only possible if the five runes were broken once by each race that been created by the Gozeds. Time passed and times of despair followed after the war, food shortage, loss of workforce took lives in most societies. The one that claimed the most was the humiz disease, a bacterial disease that was rumored to be carried by all humans, it was deadly and most often carried by pesticides. The hardship brought by the times lead to a division between the races, it became a struggle to survive at it at each race for themselves. The conflict between the races was also translated to the gozed as they also became distanced from each other. Accusations and rumors escalated and the breaking point was reached between Brimir and Kirtath as a war between the giants and dragons broke out. Lives were lost and the thousand year war resulted in the population of dragons and giants becoming greatly diminished.<br><br>With the civilizations booming in size disease and population control follows, another pandemic hit the world, and hit it hard. The Death curse pandemic was extremely deadly and spread like fire. However the nations of Drasmoor and Valuk were the ones who got most out of the pandemic, their boarders expanded exponentially due to them being religiously ruled states. Other nations weren’t as lucky as larger percentiles of their population were completely wiped out. Another rumor of the disease was that it severed one’s connection to the Ixrica Particle, this so was only for those with innate spellcasting, meaning religious priests and bishops kept their magic as their magic was borrowed. Since Drasmoor and Valuk suffered minimal losses they utilized the situation to launch holy conquests into neighboring land taking it for themselves to expand their empires. Both nations were followers of the god Erak and its three forms. The Nations who lost large percentiles were in ruins, it resulted in many abandoning their homes, the nation they lived in to move to a city where others could be found, this lead to the destruction of racal nations, as the races met in these havens, creating new cities and nations of mixed races. Time passed and the new nations grew exponentially and so did the human percentile, it skyrocketed, making humans the most common race around the world.<br><br>Timeline<br><br>Year        Event        Description<br><br>The Annihilation        Godzen Erak and Yemik fought.<br><br>B.

There were three allies in this war:<br><br>The angles, celestial beings helping the Tryax Forces<br><br>  The gem Dragons, the few known remaining ones helping the Visioneer Clan, compiled of strong wizards and Sorcerers.<br><br>  The Devils and demonic beings helping the Ferrum Axis<br><br>            The demonic beings promised the kings all the power they could ever imagine and to no longer need to fear death, they used their power to corrupt the kings minds with visions of their demise by the hand of the other nations. The demons asssisted the kings with an army, the army was demonic beings wearing full black armor. They all wore the iconic symbol of the Ferrum Axis on their armor and shields, they were firce in combat and skilled with the blade, tales have been told of them beating an 5000 man army with only 2000 soldiers. Their large army was transported through gates, know reffered to as the "Gates of Hardar". The gates powered by souls of those killed within them. With enough power the gates can once again be reactivated and a new invasnion will be launched. These gates were spread across the nations, mostly on the west side, but with some in the nation of Khun. The Axis consited of the nations of Malum, Nish<br><br>  This huge war is known as the Dark Age and The Final War, where the word mercy and peace was long forgotten,<br><br>  Basically= Devils wants to kill everyone, Angels wants to rule the world as Dictators and the Magicans are the rebelious fighting for the freedom of the living?<br><br>Allied Nations: Drasmoor, Valuk and Orevora<br><br>basically the party worked for Alvan Hoff third oldest son to the newly apointed royal family, they were the head of an adventuring guild but gained so much power within the nation they managed to overthrow the reigning elven family, the party first worked with Alvan transporting supplies to the front lines (uneasy times ment they were ready for war) they then explored the nation and wound up reaching the capital, where they walked around, they went too deep in the sewers looking for the black market and wound up crossing paths with an aspect of Gravator, a slime being resting in the sewers snatching bodies and replacing them with slime clones retaining their memories and such, Alvan turns out made a deal with the slime allowing the party to retain their memories but not their bodies, they threatened to kill him and so he made them sign a soul contract with a tiefling friend of his that their souls was now his to command, some time passed they attended an auction to snuff out rebellion sympothisers (turns out a last heir to the elven family lives and they were tasked with finding her and her allies) they instead befriend Velzane a powerful merchant in the city, she knows powerful mind altering magic which lets them talk without Gravator knowing, they get a new list from her of who to frame, time pass they do stuff eventually peace negotiations with Malum occur they attent to safekeep it, then marching is heard, Velzane, the prinecess Pierconaw arrives and so other rebels, they fight Velzane is revealed to be a powerful dragon in disguise and so fight, turns out the representative from the invading nation Malum is a powerful fiend and joins the fight, eventually teleporting out, in the fight it is discovered that Alvan replaced the royal family with slimes and planned to do so with the malum diplomats, they fight destroy Gravator and Velzane gets the planar key, the item which allows Gravator to manifest in the material plane, before the peace negotiations happened their soul contract was changed as a product of the fiend "friend" of alvan instead binding them to him instead (Siccarus) they then met up with him wondering what they can do to free themselves, he asks for the Sundering Veil to be retrived, a powerful artefact from dwarven times (containing the Soul of Duccah an evil giant lich who was the king of giants and kept dwarves as slaves) they travel to underdark, wound up freeing duccah cuz didnt want fiends to have his magic and so returned to the surface (the artefact was in the underdark given to the drow from Alvan in return they summoned the gravator avatar) and now party talked with Velzane she didnt have much for them to do and so traveled west into occupied terretory they fight fiends and help rebels and now have a list of targets, they convinced Targen to not aid the occupation and now begin their travels to Larkspur, they arrived to a swamp terrain and illusion on the nature they went there killed acoven of hags and then to the mountains nearby to find a temple for Bazdok, there they found more lore about demons (they were created by the elven followers of Valenia, and they used ancient dark magic to create the first deamons, they were strong and grew stronger with every fiend they slew, and no way to kill them as of now, the current solution was to seal them the moment they hit 0, before they dissapeared, sealing them in items and objects. In the war they were used for a while but they lost more and more control over them and it resulted in as much death and decay on each sides it was no use, they sealed them all (or so it is believed) they then experimented with the creation of half demons / demon blood combined with their slaves) which is what Bazdok is, granting him his echo knight abilities, the coven was disovered the goddess was condemmed to forgottenness and the elves became banished to the underdark, becoming drow, they continued with their rituals but as time passed and the war was over their attention went to other things, and now the party are at one of the ancient temples of the old elven pantheons discovering a tomb of a shield sealing a demon deep bellow the temple and past a maze guarded by a demon (mebe? Like its a devourer) and like after that they are to head back to Larkspur to board the ship of Man o War, a privateer ship they have paid for passage on, (Why the ship is headed there is to bring something, food rations are low over there but perhaps they are smuggling something else, generally the crew has one or another reason to hate the Malum invading forces) and now along the trip they might see something / interract with something:<br><br>Basically:<br><br>demons (they were created by the elven followers of Valenia, and they used ancient dark magic to create the first deamons, they were strong and grew stronger with every fiend they slew, and no way to kill them as of now, the current solution was to seal them the moment they hit 0, before they dissapeared, sealing them in items and objects.

With enough power the gates can once again be reactivated and a new invasnion will be launched. These gates were spread across the nations, mostly on the west side, but with some in the nation of Khun.

In the war they were used for a while but they lost more and more control over them and it resulted in as much death and decay on each sides it was no use, they sealed them all (or so it is believed) they then experimented with the creation of half demons / demon blood combined with their slaves) which is what Bazdok is, granting him his echo knight abilities, the coven was disovered the goddess was condemmed to forgottenness and the elves became banished to the underdark, becoming drow, they continued with their rituals but as time passed and the war was over their attention went to other things, and now the party are at one of the ancient temples of the old elven pantheons discovering a tomb of a shield sealing a demon deep bellow the temple and past a maze guarded by a demon (mebe? Like its a devourer) and like after that they are to head back to Larkspur to board the ship of Man o War, a privateer ship they have paid for passage on, (Why the ship is headed there is to bring something, food rations are low over there but perhaps they are smuggling something else, generally the crew has one or another reason to hate the Malum invading forces) and now along the trip they might see something / interract with something:<br><br>Basically:<br><br>demons (they were created by the elven followers of Valenia, and they used ancient dark magic to create the first deamons, they were strong and grew stronger with every fiend they slew, and no way to kill them as of now, the current solution was to seal them the moment they hit 0, before they dissapeared, sealing them in items and objects.

yes, ive told you the current story of the dungeons and dragons campaign that is set in a homebrew world, however the true enemy seems somewhat yet to fully form, they have as mentioned met and worked quite a while for Alvan hoff and know he too is in worchester, however since having gone for initially a more sandboxy world where they can choose their own path it seems more random what has happened because of it but i want it to have more of a complete story arc overal, though right now it might end up being Duccah as like a bad guy at the end? rising up after the party has fought off the invasion from Malum, having killed the generals, weakening the commanding unit of Malum enough for the Kazlac forces aided by Drasmoor to reclaim the nation, the war has been going on for a few months, and im unsure if it would even matter for the characters that the war ends, like none of them are super interested in ending it, like they are against malum but the format of a sandbox world does not work as they only do things to stop malum that themselves find convenient / are tasks literally handed to them by others and so current idea is a face off with alvan hoff in worchester after having delt with the generals there that is like the final arc of that part.... and then duccah happens? or simply alvan hoff manages to worm himself to some sort of power (what they heard is he is working for anyone he can so that he can gain some standing with the nation of malum after his failed attempt at the peace negotiations, create a structured overview of what would be best to happen next, spesific encounters guiding the characters and main storypoints needed, here are the characters in question:

they are all lvl 12

Claax Driv (satyr Bard lore) (ate some feywild stuff and will need to go to feywild soon to get that sorted (or be kidnapped, where he has consumed food from both main courts of the feywild so they argue over ownership, a competition between claax and Dola hyde will determine which court gains most strength in the feywild one side aids kazlac the other aids malum)

Bazdok Bugbear echo knight, a slave from the underdark freed by the party, looking and exploring to find and see the beauty in the world, found out his echo knight powers derive from demon blood from drow experiments / dark rituals which was why drow were cursed to live under ground and their patron banished, now he looks for more temples to find these demonic weapons and bind himself to them, with each slain devil the item grow stronger, however perhaps he will someday loose control as the shadow sometimes manifests and does as it chooses to show the way and guide him to where the shadow wants (he was made from blood of a demon, the current idea is that demons were made by drow to kill fiends, but cant be killed and grow stronger with each thing they kill

Garek Barbarian Goliath (beast, gets a tail when he rages and wants a ice themed greataxe)

Zephar Slim (Tiefling previously a troop for Malums invading forces, but then at the continous loss of knowledge brought on by the war Slim has decided to defect to work for perserving knowledge and works for an arachnid creature in the hells (warlock pact) which he tells it everything

Valtos, been away for far too long not really too relevant with the party no more but his story was relevant, served and raised by alvan hoff, assassin short elf (midget not dwarf elf) and like found out alvan killed his parents, shot and killed him but alvans servants managed to get him out of there and revive him
