   B.T (Before our Time)

There was once a time before the existance of the planes, as they all were yet to be created, and such was done by the being Brimir who created one plane, caleld the true plane.

- The true plane still lacked much, as there was yet to be much to fill it, only a silvery cloud that moved through out it

- As millenias passed the cloud slowly begun its sepperation from itself, forming different spheres

- These spheres collided with each other in such a high speed and at a heavy uneven pace, large quantities of radioactive light and enegry waves moved through the void

- Brimir used his power to sepperate these orbs, as he did, the true plane was torn into lesser pieces, the orbs all was surrounded by what was once the true plane, but now had                     become smaller planes

- Year 0 A.TP (After True Plane)

- These newer planes were created, a total of five planes were created at first, in a unimaginable figure they moved, yet the planes still kept colliding

- The radioactive rays and powerfilled shock waves moved within the planes and as the planes beared an essence from the true plane gods were created

- The gods were of Brimirs power, concisting of flakes of power from the true plane, all of them.

- These five gods were known as the "First Borns" and they had their own plane to dabble in.

- Erthur, was a being of pure light, his plane: "Arlenera" being the light of all there is

- Kirtath, a tentacle slime creature made of a black and shadowy substance, his plane being: "Dorkenem" a void filled with darkness (To become Void of planes)

- Esin, a golden cloud of heat, ruled the plane of "inferkinen" (To become plane of hell)

- Floiza, a silver snake with golden eyes, the true essence of the cloud before and ruler of the plane "Phaskenen" a toxic plane of harmful gasses and minerals

- Nireka, a green snake with blue eyes, its plane: "Eltheren" only consisting of rocks and dirt

- The planes kept colliding, trying to force themselves back together, and the gods within fought too, they fought and fended each other off with every collision

- They tried to destroy each other and take their powers, as to become the true plane once more.

- (370k A.TP) Then, at one point Kiratath fell, but as to the gods bold assumtion of absorbing his power it was released

- His defeat led to his contained plane to be broken, shattering his form through between the other planes, creating an endless void between them

- This new void soon became the lesser parts of what was once Kirataths domain.

- The newly created void between the planes slowed their combat as it became harder to collide.

- (0,3MM A.TP) But they all hit each other at once, creating a loud boom as all the planes merged, well all but one, making the missing piece be their downfall

- Without the plane of Arlenera to balance out the light plane of Arlenera the plane expanded and sepperated

- Making it even harder to form fully back once more

- (0,7MM A.TP) The gods themselves concisted of what was in their planes, making the new split have their own lesser gods and so a new war begun.

- The new gods created were

- Diaboli, his plane being of inferkinen, creating a fiery plane

- Bevlir, another part of Esin, the core of his plane was made into another plane, the plane of fire

- Akdur, became of parts of Eltheren and Phaskenen, a rocky plane called the plane of earth

- Efatra, another result of the planes colliding and mixing was the creation of Efatra, a plane combined by parts of inferkinen and Phaskenen creating the                                           plane of water

- Surfur, became the ruler of a plane that was created as Phaskenen was emptied of its minerals, leaving only gasses, creating the plane of air

- Erthina, goddess of light, does not have a plane and dwells in the material plane

- Kurath, a god of the night, does also not have a plane and dwells in the material plane,

- Erthina and Kurath were twins, two sides of the same coin who hated and constantly fought each other in the material plane.

- The combats between them led to the creation of many gods, the gods of war and hate:

- Idar, God of Hatred, fear and Tyrrany

- Ludus, God of Muder, Lies, Intrigue, Strife and trickery

- Kuas, God of death and the dead

- These three lesser dieties became ones with similar interests and held together.

- (0,9MM A.TP) There were parts of the two gods that collided, creating a strong but unstable essence around the universe, this was soon to become its                                                   own god, Igris

- And today the magical aura that flows through the universe and can be manipulated.

    - A part of this god split off, binding itself directly with all there is in the material plane, making all living beings and solid objects a                                                        part of one force, two main religions grew forth to use this power to reach their own goals, the ancient religions Gedi and Giths, giving                                                        forth the name "Swartch"

- The Material plane was created the moment the true plane sepperated, it was created in the centre of the other planes.

- The material plane was an endless sea of remains of what had escaped from each collision and hadnt been swallowed up by the void.

- The void became now a sea that flowed between planes and the material plane, a endless volume of nothingness

- There is said that a tearible being lives wihtin this void, a tentacled being having all tentacles in all planes waiting to awaken to exact its revenge on                                         those who killed Kiratath. Those who wish to awaken this creature go by the alias "Ends witness" / "Endens vitner"

- (1,3MM A.TP) The planar war was momentairly paused with the material plane sepperating the planes further.

- Allfather was a god created as the offspring from Akdur and Surfur, a mighty being that took interest in a piece of in this material plane that became "Leon"

- (1,6MM A.TP) Leon is the planet of which all is now happening, the allfather made his presence on this piece of land

- Other gods showed interest soon as well, the goddess Erthina of light wished to created life on the land, something Kurath hated the thought off

- (1,8MM A.TP) Further fighting led Kurath heavily weakened and Erthina created a bond between Bevlir and so was allowed to bring a piece of his plane to the                                             material plane, which became the sun.

- (8,2MM A.TP) As a sun blew life into the planet allfather grew pleased by the goddess of light and soon sought out to create an offspring with her.

- But, she refused, she did not care for a weakling without a plane. which enraged the allfather.

- (4,1BN A.TP) The goddess had fallen for Akdur and they together created the lesser goddess Othea

- The lesser goddess took the form of a large mountain in the world of Leon

- (4.4BN A.TP) And allfathers attention was soon found towards her, her being willing made them have children of their own, the children became the True                                             Giants and was granted a continent on the planet of Leon.

- Ruk, first hill giant

- Obadai, first Stone giant

- Ottar, first Frost Giant

- Masud, first fire giant

- Nicias, first Cloud Giant

- Vilmos, first Storm Giant

- Dunmor, first wood giant

- Lanaxis, first Titan

- Arno and Julian, a two headed Ettin

- In all there is Five Firstboorns, or rather: Pure races of this world

    - Giants

- (4,5BN A.TP) The allfather created a giant society for them to live in called "Korkana" and gave each giant a section of this empire to rule.

- Another being that grew forth was the dragons, both chromatic and metallic, they were the essence of what remained of Floiza, they took root in the different                                      terrains of the world.

- (4,8BN) A.TP) A long period of war persued betweent the dragons and the Giants, lasting for a thousand years, where they were fighting a territorial war                                         for land to control

- Many Dragons and Giants fell during this period, weakinging both sides heavily.

- To put an end to the war the Allfather and the new god of the dragons Erkos met and discussed what to do and who would win this war.

- No one truly knows what really happened with the negotiations, but the war was soon halted without a victor

- Both dragons and Giants were now heaviy weakened and the Allfather seeked to create a giant to lead them all

- But it was not as simple, the Allfather had found out that Othea had created offspring with another diety, a lesser one of the night sky known as Oesis

- Together the offspring they had created was the Dark Giants, Night Ettins, Ogres and Trolls

- Allfather grew furious and in his rage killed this lesser diety, ending its existance, something that lead to two catastrophic happenings.

- The Diety Oesis kept the night sky up and the night frost away, and with him gone soon a rain of frost meteors continueslty fell each night,                                                       growing in intensity.

- The other was Othea now despised Allfather and refused to bear his child

- And so the Allfather had his way with the resisting Diety, impregnating her

- She threatened to kill the child if Allfather didnt keep his distance and wait until the offspring called his name with all giants united                                                         before he was allowed to return

- The Giants that remained gathered in their city to reach a way to stop the swarm of meteors that fell each night, but was stopped by Othea as                                                      she deemed it their punishment.

- The Giants were cursed by her and with them even fewer now lived scattered as their capital hads been ruined by frost and meteors.

- The son of Othea and and Allfather was borns years later, but it wasnt a healthy child and was much smaller than the previous giants

- The son was given the name "Kelu" and soon gained a small following as he laid claim to the throne of giants

- But his size made it so the other giants didnt belive him, and began to fight against him, resulting in the hairs death

- As the Last son of the Allfather died a large Crackling thunder spread across the sky as the Allfather was enraged by their foolishness

- The allfather cursed his children, cursed them so that they would not be able to gain their strength back until a new hair came and united                                                        them to a nation

- Forcing the giants to live amongst humans and other beings further reducing their numbers.

- Now only less than thousand giants exists of each kind.

    - (4,5BN A.TP) Dragons

        - When fire was brought to the material plane to create life on Leon, some escaped from the sun down to the planet, the raw fire essence landed in the continent                                     to the east.

            - In the world of Leon creatures begun to be bound to it, most died, however one race could bear the heat

                - A Wyvern by the Name "Durkuas" survived the fusion and was now fuled by the godly power

                    - A new race was now created, dragons

                    - (3,6MM A.TP) Durkuas had one daughter and one son, youngest was a chromatic with multiple heads by the name "Penhucar", the older dragon was a                                                   metallic dragon having shifting colores and has the name "Kelher"

                                                - the two draons had their own offspring

                                                    - Kelher had ones of different metals

                                                        - Iron, Brass, Bronze, Copper, Steel, Silver, Electrum, Gold, Platinum, Mithril and Adamantine draogns

                                                    - Penhucar had ones of the different chromatic colors

                                                        - Red, Black, Blue, Green, White, Brown, Purple, Gray, Yellow

                                                - (3,8MM A.TP) The different dragons held different values and interests from each other, making co-existing an issue.

                                                    - (3,9MM A.TP And while the war between them and the giants had weakened them they begun to prepare a civil war, and it lasted for thousands                                                        of years

                                                        - The war resulted in the continent being split by the Dragon God Durkuas sending the east side with the metallics

                                                        As millenials past the dragon god beared a last daughter, Tanzanir, a draon which consisted of the different gemstones to be found in the                                                                regions.

                                                            - But the draons in newer times were hunted down by other races as their value was far to great, leaving only a few hundres hidden                                                                  around the world

                                                    - Tanzanir had ones of different gemstones

                                                        -Amber, Amethyst, Aquamarine, Diamond, Emerald, Jade, Moonstone, Morganite, Opal, Pearl, Ruby, Sapphire, Sunstone, Tanzanite, Tourmaline,                                                           Turquoise, Zircon
