- Fierce guardians of Fairy Forts, usually described as natural places.
- Stealing children and replacing them with Changeling Duplicates
- Apparently arbitrary changes of allegiance or attitude, betraying centuries old alliances on a whim, or siding with old enemies without a second thought.
    


From these I decided Fairies had the following qualities:
- Fierce guardianship of Nature.
    
- A sense of fairness that doesn't need to be agreed upon by both parties
    
- Love of Spontaneity.
    


- We are simply another part of nature, to do anything but accept your place on the food chain is heinous.
    
- All deals and trades must be equal.
    
- It is best and greatest to do that which is dramatic for the moment, to stick to a plan or side even when it becomes uninteresting is heinous.



#### Typical weaknesses and Traits

- **Weakness to Iron** - This is a big one that I generally recommend changing. Fae in almost all Celtic myth are weak to Iron, or cannot pass over it. I'd recommend changing this to a special type of Iron in your game, perhaps one that's difficult to get. Otherwise, the party is going to be walking around essentially carrying Fae kryptonite all of the time.
    
- **Inability to tell a direct lie** - This one's fun. Fae cannot directly lie. This does not mean, in any way, they have to tell the truth though. They are almost as famous as Djinn or Devils for twisting words, telling half-truths, or bending interpretation.
    
- **Dealmakers** - Oh yes. The Fae are fond of deals with humans. Usually ones that human thinks is beneficial to them, but actually winds up only benefiting the Fae do to a trick of wording. These deals are usually magically bound, and hell will be wreaked upon the human that doesn't uphold their end.
    
- **True Name** - Here's one pretty unique to Fairies. In a lot of the old tales, Fae have a common name, and a True Name. Learning/Invoking the True Name will summon the fairy to you, and usually bind it to your will. This could make a fun sidequest, or just a way to set up a Patronship.
    
- **Must be Invited** - In the really Old Tales, Fae were like Vampires, they actually had to be invited in.
    
- **Curious** - In many, many tales, the Fae aren't actually malevolent towards humanity, so much as they are fascinated/confused by them. They want to know how humans work, and have their own methods of getting about figuring it out.
