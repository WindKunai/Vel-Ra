- **[[Solar Court|The Solar]] and [[The Suncrest Court|Suncrest]] court**s form the backbone of **Daytime power**, aligned in ideology but sometimes compete culturally and politically with **[[The Bloomrise Court]]** and **[[The Virescent Court|Virecent]]**, who favor natural chaos and resilience over imposed order.
    
- **[[The Virescent Court]]** is largely **isolated**, distrustful of many other courts due to their rigid or commercial nature.
    
- The **Night Courts** form a fragile alliance centered around **[[Lunar Court]]**’s influence, with **Silver Thorns** as dangerous outsiders plotting for dominance.
    
- **Twilight Courts** operate mostly **outside direct political struggles**, focusing on liminal spaces and transitions, but have **deep wariness toward [[Lunar Court]]**.
    
- **[[The Court of Ten Thousand Leaves]]** tries to mediate between **Day Courts**, often caught between their conflicting priorities, creating tension.
    
- **[[The Court of Feather and Silence]]** acts as an **arbiter** among Night courts but is distrusted by some, especially the **[[The Court of Silver Thorns]]**.
