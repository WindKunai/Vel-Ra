### Frostfall Eladrin

The Frostfall Eladrin embody the stark, quiet beauty of winter’s grip in the Feywild. Their skin often carries a pale, almost crystalline sheen, reflecting the ice and snow that define their court. Clad in robes woven from frost-laced silk and adorned with delicate ice-blue gemstones, these Eladrin move with a serene grace that echoes the stillness of frozen landscapes.

Their demeanor is calm, contemplative, and sometimes distant—mirroring the long, cold nights they govern. They excel in magic that manipulates cold, shadow, and preservation, favoring subtle enchantments that freeze time or sap vitality without rash destruction. The Frostfall Eladrin are keepers of forgotten memories and ancient secrets, often serving as scholars, sages, and wardens of sacred winter shrines hidden deep in snow-capped mountains or beneath frostbitten groves.

Socially, they prize endurance, quiet resilience, and stoicism. Their political style is slow and deliberate, reflecting the patience required to survive harsh winters. While not openly hostile, they view the fiery passions of the Suncrest Eladrin with wary respect, often disapproving of their warmth and impulsiveness.

### Bloomrise Eladrin

The Bloomrise Eladrin are vibrant, whimsical embodiments of spring’s renewal and youthful growth. Their skin often glows with soft greens and floral hues, petals and vines naturally weaving through their hair and clothing as if the forest itself grows from them. They are playful, curious, and deeply connected to the wild, untamed aspects of the Feywild’s natural world.

Masters of growth and renewal magic, the Bloomrise Eladrin excel at accelerating the blooming of flowers, healing wounds, and weaving illusions from morning mist and sunlight. They inhabit the lush jungles and flowering forests, where their homes are crafted from living trees and blooming flowers, shifting with the seasons like living artworks.

Their society thrives on creativity, freedom, and chaos—the antithesis of rigid structure. They often clash politically with courts that value order, particularly the Suncrest and Virescent Courts. Bloomrise Eladrin are natural explorers and adventurers, leading expeditions into untamed Feywild territory and occasionally venturing into the Material Plane, drawn by the thrill of discovery and change.

### Suncrest Eladrin

The Suncrest Eladrin reflect the full glory and maturity of summer stretching into early autumn, where life is vibrant but tinged with the promise of eventual decay. Their skin shimmers with golden and amber tones, as if sunlight itself pulses beneath their flesh. They dress in fine, flowing garments woven from golden threads and accented with autumn leaves, sunflowers, and beeswax motifs.

As fervent defenders of legacy, honor, and tradition, Suncrest Eladrin are the staunchest advocates of hierarchy and societal structure among the Fey courts. They rule the soaring golden temples perched on the floating islands of the Feywild’s skies, their politics marked by ceremony, discipline, and martial prowess. Their magic commands the warmth of the sun, the ripening of fruits, and the fierce protection of harvests.

Suncrest Eladrin pride themselves on their strong sense of duty and leadership, often serving as generals, diplomats, and judges. They maintain uneasy alliances with the Solar Court and the Court of Honey, while frequently finding themselves at odds with the free-spirited Bloomrise Eladrin and the isolationist Virescent Court. Their worldview emphasizes endurance through strength and order, the cycle of life and death embraced with dignity.
