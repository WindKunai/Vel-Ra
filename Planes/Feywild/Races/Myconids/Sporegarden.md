### Sporegardens

Myconids cultivate an enormous variety of fungi for purposes ranging from alchemy to defense to decor, often spreading over regions dozens of miles across.

These fungal hazards entrench myconid circles, ensuring that any would-be invaders suffer years or decades of intractable dangers even if they manage to kill or displace the community.

Those that suffer a negative effect from toxic fungi can make a Constitution saving throw to resist it, with the DC ranging from 10-15 depending on the maturity and density of the growths.
