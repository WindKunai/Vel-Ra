**Nature:** Forgotten things, abandoned oaths, wandering spirits  
**Domain:** Fog-choked clearings, ruined banquet halls with place settings for the vanished, overgrown paths that lead nowhere but remember you  
**Notable Races:** Lostling goblins, mourning eladrin, worgs without names, whisper-fey, memory-starved bugbears  
**Rivals:** Pale Reflection (_“They copy what fades. We _carry_ it.”_)  
**Vibe:** Names carved in trees and forgotten, fey who wander until they forget why, a court of orphans and exiles who made a crown from absence
