- **Domain**: Multiplicity, memory, seasonal change, the turning of time
    
- **Region**: Vast forest with the _other_ main city (north)
    
- **City**: Yes — this is the largest “courtly” city, perhaps with a vast eladrin presence.
    
- **Hobgoblin Role**: **Archivists, seasonal heralds, and oathkeepers.** These hobgoblins are highly valued for their memory and loyalty. They form the **Chronicler's Vow**, an order of scribes and messengers that carry court decrees across the island. Some serve as martial commanders in defense of seasonal change (especially against twilight incursions).

**Goblinoid Roles**:


- **Goblins**: Moss-crawlers, burrowers, vine-weavers. They help the court spread green decay. They act as **repairers of living architecture**, using fungus and root to reinforce collapsed stone.
    
- **Hobgoblins**: **Earthbound wardens**, builders, and record-keepers. They’re the **memory of stone**, guiding construction and honoring ruin through patient care.
    
- **Bugbears**: Powerful **watchers of the deep jungle**, unseen until it’s too late. They are keepers of what _should remain untouched_.
    
- **Worgs**: Burrowing breeds or jungle-adapted — **moss-furred**, sleek and camouflaged, used for heavy transport and ruin patrols.
