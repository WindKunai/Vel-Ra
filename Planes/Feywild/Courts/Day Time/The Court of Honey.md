**Goblinoid Roles**:

- **Goblins**: Hive-runners, nectar thieves turned pollinators. Many are **pollen scouts** or dust-glider riders (glider wings to ride desert winds).
    
- **Hobgoblins**: Form the **Order of the Golden Bell** — structured, lawful, communicative. Responsible for the protection and logistics of desert trade routes, temple maintenance, and civic harmony.
    
- **Bugbears**: The **silent fists** of the court. They enforce peace not with presence but with threat — appearing only when needed, serving as bodyguards to high-ranking Concord druids or priestesses.
    
- **Worgs**: Sleek desert-bred — they work in **sand caravans**, hauling honeyglass, spice, and sacred wax. Often have crystalline teeth from desert minerals.
