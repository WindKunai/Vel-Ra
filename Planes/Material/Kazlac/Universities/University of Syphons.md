Univesity of Syphons was created thousands of years ago and its oldest school, which is in the capital is said to hold tales and stories from way back, well it used to as of recent a new family has taken the throne and they raided the archives and ruined the collections in attempts to erase any trace from the previous royal family. As a result of such the archives are now incomplete, with large sections missing, especially those on the last time the nation was at war with Malum.

Vincary Dilac Syphon. The creator of the university is said to once have been a nobody, without any nobility or gold to his name, then over time he honed his skills in the arcane arts as his study of magic continued. Though his research, and through his practice his powers became more and more sought out, and through his power he created the first University of the nation, Univeristy of Syphons. A few yeares passed and He and his brother grew to be the most powerful men in Kazlac. That was until he was struck with despair, his brother had gone out on an expedition to the wildlands of Kraz with his fellow scholars. The fellow scholars were all other powerful and renowned magic wielders from the corners of the known world. Yet one day V.D Syphons received word that all nine of them had gone missing without a trace. When he sent mercenaries and questors to find them he was informed no trace was found, but something weird a blue layer of crystal particles layed over the wildlands of Kraz, and it seemed to drain who ever entered the lands' ability to use magic... draining the casters of their magical force.

Unable to find his brother Syphon mourned his brother and created a guild which his brother had spoken so many times of creating, a guild of what equivalates as magical merchants, collectors and scholars of magical knowledge all working together to solve all the mysteries the world has to offer.  Their main mission, to find out what happened to Vincary's brother. However no one today know if they ever succeeded or not.

The disappearance and lack of answers drove the arch mage insane, every stone turned, every inch investigated, but nothing, no information, no answer to his questions, this was something he had never experienced before, and so it is said that in his dispair and insanity he used what he himself had restricted as forbidden magic to transform himself beyond his form... into something ungodly... all in his newfound quest for survival. It is said he to this day is still around somewhere...in abandoned crypts and dungeons made by his mad mind... of course all of this is rumors.....
