The creature resembles a large, stony goblin, with an oversized head and leering grin. It has a mossy beard, massive shoulders, and long forearms.

Abandoned Servants. The domovoi were the portal guards and house lackeys of the elvish nobility, and when elves leave a place, the domovoi are often left behind. Some say the domovoi are left on purpose, while others say the domovoi are too attached to their homes to follow the elves to far-flung locales.

Debt Collectors. These smirking stragglers seek work as tireless sentinels and fey button men, collecting debts for criminal syndicates. They delight in frustrating the progress of would-be thieves and tomb robbers, and they enjoy roughing up weaker creatures with their powerful, stony fists.

House Guardian. When the domovoi finishes a long rest in a structure with up to 2,500 square feet of floor space, the structure becomes magically protected. This works like the guards and wards spell, except the domovoi can choose only two effects from the spell to place in the warded area.

Actions

Multiattack. The domovoi makes two Slam attacks.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

Invisibility. The domovoi magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the domovoi wears or carries is invisible with it.

Spellcasting. The domovoi casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

At will: alter self

3/day each: darkness, haste

Bonus Actions

Protector’s Step. The domovoi magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space within a structure protected by its House Guardian trait or within 30 feet of the exterior of that structure. Swirls of golden light, sparkles of starlight, or tendrils of inky shadow (the domovoi’s choice) appear at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.
