Dressed in hunting leathers with a thick bearskin cloak around his shoulders, the bearded king sits upon a throne carved from a whole tree trunk. A crown of holly leaves wreathes his head, and a blackened maul rests near his hand. An ornate clay pot filled with honey hangs at his hip.

Mesikammen the Bear King, called “Old Honey Paws,” rules the northern Kingdom of the Bear. Its forests are thick with bears, and bearfolk and werebears are common among its people.

Abuzz with Bees. The country’s chief product and export, thanks to the Bear King’s insatiable appetite for sweets, is honey. The Bear King’s hive-keepers harvest rich, blossom-sweet honey from the hives of giant bees they tend. The land’s brewers use the honey to create the finest mead, and the most potent brews are infused with fey glamour.

Boisterous Revels. The Bear King and his court of bear jarls, witches, and oracles spend most of their time hunting in the hills, feasting, brawling, and drinking mead. Old Honey Paws maintains his rulership over this court by besting all rivals in a yearly series of challenges. The challenges are open to anyone, but the Bear King has defeated all comers since he rose to the throne.

An exceptionally furry and regal man with bear paws sits on a throne of branches and wood-carved bees while cradling a honey jar.

Bear King’s Lair

The Bear King’s fortress thrusts up from the foothills of a mountain range like a petrified wave. The lair is riddled with caves and tunnels and contains the court of the Bear King.

Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Bear King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Bear King can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

    Quake. A minor quake starts on a point the Bear King can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

    Summon Bees. The lair’s denizens rise up to defend their king, causing 2d4 giant bees (see Tome of Beasts 2 or use the statistics of a giant wasp) to appear in unoccupied spaces of the Bear King’s choice within 60 feet of him. The bees act on initiative count 20, are allies of the Bear King, and obey his spoken commands. The bees remain until the Bear King dies or until he dismisses them as a bonus action. The Bear King can have no more than eight giant bees under his control at one time.

    Ursine Transformation. One creature the Bear King can see within 30 feet of him must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or transform into a brown bear as if the creature had failed a saving throw against the polymorph spell. While transformed, the creature must move to and attack a target chosen by the Bear King on each of its turns. The transformation lasts until the Bear King dies or until he uses this lair action again. The transformed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the transformation on itself on a success.

Regional Effects

The region surrounding the Bear King’s lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

    Angry Bees. Bees within 10 miles of the Bear King’s lair are easily agitated and quick to attack Humanoids that aren’t bearfolk or werebears.

    Call of the Bear King. Within 5 miles of the Bear King’s lair, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid contracting lycanthropy from a werebear.

    Heightened Passions. Emotions within 10 miles of the Bear King’s lair run high. Arguments quickly descend into physical scuffles and enjoyable get-togethers are likely to become raucous carousing.

If the Bear King dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

Honey Toss. The Bear King throws a jar of magical honey at a creature he can see within 120 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by sticky honey until the end of its next turn.

Frightful Roar (Costs 2 Actions). The Bear King lets out a blood-curdling roar. Each hostile creature within 60 feet of the Bear King and that can hear the roar must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
