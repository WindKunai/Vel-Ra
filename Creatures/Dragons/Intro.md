### **Origin**

Kirtath — the First Flame and Progenitor of all true dragons — manifested in the world with a body of two halves:

- **Vaeryth**, the Platinum Head — intellect, rulership, order.
    
- **Xarvog**, the Iron Maw — ferocity, ambition, dominance.
    

When Kirtath’s essence fractured (likely due to a great cataclysm or magical war), Vaeryth and Xarvog each took their share of draconic essence and shaped it according to their nature:

- **Metallic Dragons** (Vaeryth’s brood) were designed to consolidate territory, rule it wisely, and protect what was theirs. They value legacy over expansion, stability over chaos.
    
- **Chromatic Dragons** (Xarvog’s brood) were designed to expand endlessly, conquer new lands, and crush opposition. To them, _stagnation is decay_.

### **The Civil War**

Once they had carved vast dominions from giant-ruled lands during the Thousand-Year War, the dragons’ shared purpose ended.

- **Chromatics** saw the peace as an opportunity wasted — the world was still ripe for conquest.
    
- **Metallics** saw it as a time to build civilization and cement their power.
    

The war between them lasted centuries, devastating the mortal realms.  
It ended not in true peace, but in **separation**:

- Metallic dragons retreated into alliances with the rising “holy” empires — the **Trinity of Light** — shaping nations that claimed moral authority, law, and divine right.
    
- Chromatic dragons aligned with **Malum** and fiendish patrons (many from Lod), feeding their hunger for conquest through mortal proxies.

## **Draconic Servitor Races**

### **[[Kobold|Kobolds]]**

- **Origin**: Created by both dragon factions in the early days of empire-building. They were bred from lesser reptilian creatures, infused with small fragments of draconic essence to give them cunning and loyalty.
    
- **Role**: Miners, tunnel-builders, lair-keepers. They maintain hoards, dig fortresses, and run complex underground networks for their masters.
    
- **Politics**:
    
    - Metallic-aligned kobolds tend to serve as archivists, engineers, and lair-guardians.
        
    - Chromatic-aligned kobolds act as raiders, spies, and saboteurs.
        
    - Kobolds respect all dragons but are fanatically loyal to “their” patron line, and inter-faction betrayal is almost unheard of.

### **[[Dragonkin]]**

- **Origin**: The first large-scale “hybrid” project — mortal stock magically altered to serve as elite soldiers and enforcers for dragons. Physically powerful, with a diluted but stable strain of draconic blood.
    
- **Role**:
    
    - Bodyguards, war-leaders, and commanders of mortal troops.
        
    - Often entrusted with enforcing draconic law or leading raids into enemy territory.
        
- **Politics**:
    
    - Many metallic-allied dragonkin became noble houses in human and elven lands under the Trinity of Light.
        
    - Chromatic-allied dragonkin became warlords and pirate kings under Malum’s banner.

### **[[Dragonborn]]**

- **Origin**: Born of direct magical transformation — mortals reshaped to carry concentrated draconic essence, often as a reward for great service. Unlike dragonkin, their link to a specific dragon’s blood is much stronger and sometimes temporary.
    
- **Role**: Champions, emissaries, and living symbols of draconic power.
    
- **Politics**:
    
    - Metallic-allied dragonborn often serve as envoys or paladins in the Trinity of Light’s armies.
        
    - Chromatic-aligned dragonborn are war-priests, executioners, or personal agents of a dragon lord.
        
    - Many dragonborn are bound by oaths that magically compel loyalty to the bloodline that transformed them.

**Why the divide endures**  
The metallic–chromatic split is not just ideology — it’s biological. The essence each dragon type inherited from Vaeryth or Xarvog shapes their instincts:

- Metallics feel satisfaction in control and permanence.
    
- Chromatics feel restless without expansion and conquest.
    
- Kobolds, dragonkin, and dragonborn inherit _shadows_ of these instincts, reinforcing faction loyalty across generations.
