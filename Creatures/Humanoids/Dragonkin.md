**Origin**: The first large-scale “hybrid” project — mortal stock magically altered to serve as elite soldiers and enforcers for dragons. Physically powerful, with a diluted but stable strain of draconic blood.
    
- **Role**:
    
    - Bodyguards, war-leaders, and commanders of mortal troops.
        
    - Often entrusted with enforcing draconic law or leading raids into enemy territory.
        
- **Politics**:
    
    - Many metallic-allied dragonkin became noble houses in human and elven lands under the Trinity of Light.
        
    - Chromatic-allied dragonkin became warlords and pirate kings under Malum’s banner.


### **Appearance**


Dragonkin are winged, draconic humanoids crafted by ancient dragons as living weapons and envoys. They stand taller than most mortals, their scaled hides gleaming in patterns that echo their lineage. Each Dragonkin inherits a deep-seated hunger for magic, an instinct from their draconic creators.

Dragonkin stand taller than most humanoids, with a presence that feels halfway between mortal and true dragon. Their scales range from ocher and deep bronze to reddish-brown, often marked with mottled stripes, bands, or spot-patterns unique to their lineage. Their broad, leathery wings are fully functional — some matching their body hue, others shimmering with metallic or gemlike undertones.

Their faces carry a draconic structure — elongated snouts, slitted eyes, and rear-sweeping horns — but framed with thick manes or spines running from brow to neck. When agitated, thin wisps of smoke escape their nostrils, and their deep-set eyes take on a dangerous glint. Their blood is a dense black ichor, laced with faint magical luminescence.

### **Instinct & Personality**

Dragonkin are born with a subtle but constant hum in their mind — the innate sense of magic. This _magnesis toward the arcane_ drives them to covet enchanted items, hoards, and relics.

- In the wild, this instinct is almost irresistible: they will focus on foes bearing magical arms or armor, striking decisively to seize them, often disengaging entirely once their prize is claimed.
    
- In more disciplined societies, particularly those under metallic dragon influence, this compulsion is trained into a refined “treasure sense” — not just for theft, but for appraisal, negotiation, and magical study.
    

While driven by their instincts, Dragonkin are not mindless hoarders. Many see their hoards as marks of status, legacy, or tools to strengthen their people. But in moments of high stress, the primal hunger for magic can override reason.

### **Origins**

Dragonkin were not an accident of nature — they were **crafted deliberately**.

- **Metallic Dragonkin**: Created as elite guardians, generals, and keepers of draconic law. Their compulsions were tempered with discipline, and their winged mobility made them ideal battlefield tacticians.
    
- **Chromatic Dragonkin**: Forged as shock troops and aerial raiders. They leaned into their magic-hunger as a weapon, disrupting enemy supply lines and stealing relics mid-battle to break morale.
    

Over centuries, many Dragonkin have broken from their creators’ factions, becoming mercenaries, adventurers, or even founders of small independent enclaves.

---

### **Relations**

- **With Kobolds**: A complicated bond. Kobolds see Dragonkin as living proof of draconic blessing, but resent their higher status and independence.
    
- **With Dragonborn**: Mutual respect, but some tension — Dragonborn are closer to _pure_ draconic essence, while Dragonkin are seen as “engineered” servants.
    
- **With True Dragons**: Even when free, Dragonkin instinctively show deference to great wyrms, though many feel conflicted about this inherited loyalty.

##### **Breath Weapon**

You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your **Draconic Ancestry** determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.  
When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area must make a **Dexterity** saving throw (for lines) or a **Constitution** saving throw (for cones), with the DC equal to **8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus**.  
On a failed save, the creature takes **2d10** damage of the type associated with your ancestry, or half as much on a successful save.

The damage increases to **3d10** at 5th level, **4d10** at 11th level, and **5d10** at 17th level.  
Once you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
