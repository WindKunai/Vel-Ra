- **Origin**: Created by both dragon factions in the early days of empire-building. They were bred from lesser reptilian creatures, infused with small fragments of draconic essence to give them cunning and loyalty.
    
- **Role**: Miners, tunnel-builders, lair-keepers. They maintain hoards, dig fortresses, and run complex underground networks for their masters.
    
- **Politics**:
    
    - Metallic-aligned kobolds tend to serve as archivists, engineers, and lair-guardians.
        
    - Chromatic-aligned kobolds act as raiders, spies, and saboteurs.
        
    - Kobolds respect all dragons but are fanatically loyal to “their” patron line, and inter-faction betrayal is almost unheard of.
