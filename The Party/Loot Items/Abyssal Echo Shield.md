_**"The First Blood never dies—it only waits."**_

- **+1 Shield**
- **Echo of the Abyss**: While an echo is active, the shield’s sigils glow crimson. The echo gains:
    
    - **+1d6 necrotic damage** on attacks (scaling to 2d6 at Level 15).
        
    - **+5** **reach**  to attacks made with echo.
        

Plan:

- Killing 1 Greater Fiend: Fire Resistance (Demonic like skin coveres the bark and sores from the wood blessing thing)
    
- Ability like once per lr to have the shadow explode when taking the attack for somebody
    
- Perhaps killing too many is bad?

#### Later abilities:
1. Retractable, now able to transform it into a black metallic- gauntlet
2. Explosive Parry: The echo detonates on being hit, dealing 3d6 + CON mod piercing damage (Dex DC 16 for half) in a 10-ft radius. The echo is destroyed.
	Limit: Once per short/long rest (or 1/day if that’s too frequent).
	No free resummon: Bazdok must use his bonus action to recreate the echo (standard Echo Knight rules).
