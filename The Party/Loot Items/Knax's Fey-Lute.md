_A beautifully crafted pan flute made of ancient Whistlewood from the feywild, bound together by Sylvansilk (Silk from Moon Moths). If you hold it up to your ear, you can hear a faint melody, barely unrecognizable from it. While using this Pan Flute, you gain a +2 bonus to the saving throw DC of your bard spells.

As an action, you can play an instrument for up to one minute, granting yourself and allies within a 10' radius around you one of the following benefits. Your allies must be able to hear you, and the song will end early if you are silenced, unconscious, or incapacitated, or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). 

It requires a Bonus Action to switch which song you are playing, and you must maintain concentration as though you were concentrating on a spell. As an action, you may switch the song you are playing, but you do not gain any additional playing time. After playing a song in this fashion (even if you end it early), you must take a Short or Long Rest before playing a song in this fashion again.

**Song of Safety:**  
§ Allies add your Charisma modifier to Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.  
**Song of Accuracy:**  
§ Your allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls.  
**Song of Denial:**  
§ Enemies must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to enter the aura.  
**Song of Healing:**  
§ Allies regain 1d6 + your Charisma modifier in hit points at the start of their turn while in the aura.
